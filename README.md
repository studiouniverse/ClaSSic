# Classic
A CSS library for creating clean, simple websites. Used at http://studiouniver.se. 

Simple demo: https://studiouniverse.github.io/Classic/

Classic is in BETA and should be considered incomplete.

Classic is in no way associated, but is heavily inspired by: [Jason Hibbs](http://jasonhibbs.co.uk/) (who made [Pugless](https://github.com/jasonhibbs/Pugless)) and [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
