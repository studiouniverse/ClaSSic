Inspired by designer [Jason Hibbs](http://jasonhibbs.co.uk/) (who made [Pugless](https://github.com/jasonhibbs/Pugless)), and the popular [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) library.

Maintained as part of [`Studio Universe`](https://studiouniverse.co)'s in-house toolkit. Bored of jQuery? Check out [`Hermes`](https://github.com/studiouniverse/Hermes).
